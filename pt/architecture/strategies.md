# Estrat√©gias

New strategies can be added or removed at any time to respond to new market realities and diversify risk.

At launch, OUSD will take advantage of a single strategy and deploy deposited capital to Compound. We intend to deploy many other strategies soon thereafter.

Once we migrate to decentralized governance, it is our intent for the community to propose new strategies and to vote on the appropriate weight for each strategy in the pool. We anticipate that most OUSD holders will value having some exposure to higher yield opportunities while maintaining more conservative positions for a portion of the funds.
