# OGN Staking

Origin Token (OGN) is intended as the governance token for OUSD and OGN will play an increasingly important role as the Origin Platform becomes more decentralized. Today, users can stake their OGN tokens to earn additional OGN after a chosen staking period has elapsed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Visit the [OUSD DApp](https://www.ousd.com/stake) in a web3-enabled browser to stake your OGN.
{% endhint %}

The initial staking program offers three staking periods and respective yields:

* 30-day staking period: Earn 7.5% annualized interest
* 90-day staking period: Earn 12.5% annualized interest
* 365-day staking period: Earn 25% annualized interest

Staked tokens will be locked for the duration of the staking period. After each staking period ends, you will be able to claim both your initial OGN (principal) and yield.
