# Audits

{% hint style="danger" %}
The OUSD smart contracts have not yet been audited. We strongly recommend reviewing our smart contracts before depositing significant amounts of capital.

**OUSD**

Audits have already been scheduled with the respected security firm, [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), for early October 2020. Their audit results will be publicly released as soon as they are available.

**Supported Strategies**

Multiple audits for Compound have already been completed and are available on their website. This includes the original code for the modified [Timelock](../smart-contracts/api/timelock-1.md) that OUSD is using.
