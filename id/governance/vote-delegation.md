# Vote Delegation

OGN holders can forward their voting power on the [Governance Portal](https://vote.originprotocol.com/#/) to another Ethereum address. Choosing this option does not strip the delegator of their voting power. The delegatee receives the extra voting power only on proposals the delegator has not voted on.

This is convenient when users want someone they trust or even one of Origin's team members to make governance decisions regarding Origin's ecosystem. It is also useful when users have OGN stored more safely in a hardware wallet and don’t want to go through the hassle of connecting it to the computer. A more accessible Ethereum wallet e.g. Metamask can be used to vote by having voting power delegated to it from the hardware wallet.\


**How to Delegate**

* Go to: [https://snapshot.org/#/delegate](https://snapshot.org/#/delegate).
* Type in the address or ENS name you want to delegate to.
* There is an option to limit the delegation power to only Origin’s products by selecting _Limit delegation to a specific space_ and typing in “origingov.eth”.
* Click confirm to save your delegation.\
