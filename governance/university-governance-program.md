# University Governance Program

In an effort to engage more university students with Origin Protocol governance, university blockchain organizations will be eligible for a temporary delegation of veOGV tokens to engage in DAO governance. The veOGV provided is expected to be utilized in the voting processes on the OUSD [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/ousdgov.eth) and [hardvote](https://governance.ousd.com/) pages.

To get started, university blockchain organizations may [contact Origin](https://calendly.com/peter-origin-protocol/30min?month=2023-03) for an initial screening call. If approved, Origin will delegate a predetermined amount of veOGV to an Ethereum wallet address controlled by the university blockchain organization.

The tokens delegated to university blockchain organizations are expected to be used for the sole purpose of voting on governance proposals. Organizations are also encouraged to propose their own proposals, and can use one of the [templates](../guides/governance-templates/) as a guide.
