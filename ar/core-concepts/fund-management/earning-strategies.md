# Earning Strategies

Earning strategies put deployed capital to work across various DeFi platforms. The Vault will determine which strategies are active and what percentage of deployed capital they will receive.

In addition, strategies will be upgraded over time. For example, at launch, there will be an initial [Compound strategy](../supported-strategies/compound.md). Over time, this may be replaced by a v2 or v3 Compound strategy.
