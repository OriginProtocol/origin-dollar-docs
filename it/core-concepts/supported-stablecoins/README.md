# Stablecoin supportate

**Stablecoin supportate**

E' fondamentale capire che OUSD è tanto forte quanto le stablecoin che lo supportano, non di più. Qualsiasi perdita agli asset sottostanti causerà una perdita analoga al valore di OUSD.

Attualmente, OUSD supporta le seguenti stablecoin:

{% content-ref url="usdt.md" %}
[usdt.md](usdt.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="usdc.md" %}
[usdc.md](usdc.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="dai.md" %}
[dai.md](dai.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

None of these stablecoins are perfect, but we selected them because of their widespread usage. While these stablecoins have lost their USD peg on multiple occasions, they have demonstrated resiliency in eventually getting back to their 1 USD targets.

It is important to note that all these stablecoins introduce non-trivial counter-party risk. Tether, in particular, has had well-documented banking troubles and regulatory challenges. In addition, both USDT and USDC have backdoors that grant their issuers the power to freeze money in their holder's wallets. While DAI does not have any direct backdoors, its assets can also be negatively impacted since USDC and USDT are accepted as collateral for minting DAI.

Despite these concerns, there are already billions of dollars betting on the security of these stablecoins. It is possible that additional stablecoins will be added to the protocol over time. Support may also be removed if any of these stablecoins prove to be too unreliable or put OUSD holder's funds in jeopardy.
