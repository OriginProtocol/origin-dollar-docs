# Audits

**Continuously audited**

Origin currently has a continuous auditing agreement with [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com) to constantly review 100% of our smart contract changes. OpenZeppelin has audited Coinbase, Ethereum, Aave, Compound, and other leading projects. They are one of the most trusted auditing firms in the industry and we are thrilled to count them as part of our extended team.
